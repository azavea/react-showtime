# Demo site for React Showtime

Uses `react-showtime` from `..`, so any changes there are automatically reflected here during development.

Created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

1.  `yarn start` in `../src/` to watch for local changes to `react-showtime`,
2.  `yarn start` here to watch for changes to the demo site and run a dev server.
